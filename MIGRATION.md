# Discord.js Migration Notes

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to update the codebase to be compatible with the latest Discord.js API changes.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated All Command Files**
   - Changed `ephemeral: true` to `flags: { ephemeral: true }` 
   - Removed unnecessary `ephemeral: true` from `editReply()` calls
   - Added checks to prevent double handling of interactions
   - Improved error handling with try-catch blocks

2. **Updated InteractionCreate Event Handler**
   - Added checks for already handled interactions
   - Updated error handling to use the new flags syntax
   - Improved null/undefined handling for options

3. **Package Dependencies**
   - Updated discord.js to specific version 14.14.1 (previously ^14.x)
   - Updated dotenv to specific version 16.4.5 (previously ^16.x)

## Why These Changes Were Needed

Discord.js deprecated the use of the `ephemeral` property directly in interaction options. The new recommended approach is to use the `flags` property with `ephemeral` set within it.

Additionally, there were issues with "Interaction has already been acknowledged" errors that were occurring because:
1. The bot was trying to reply to the same interaction multiple times
2. There were race conditions in the error handling code
3. The interaction state wasn't being properly checked before responding

## How to Test

1. Verify the bot starts without errors
2. Test each command to ensure it responds as expected
3. Pay special attention to error handling by intentionally causing errors

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a more robust interaction handling pattern
2. Add more comprehensive error logging
3. Consider using a factory pattern for standardized command responses
